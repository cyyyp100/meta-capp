  request templates.

## [0.1.0] — Initial public release

### Added

- **Free-scroll PDF reader**: the document is rendered page by page at full fidelity,
  with no reconstruction and no progression locks.
- **Embodied assistant "Gemma"**: an animated bubble over the page with idle, reading,
  thinking, answering, intervention and sleeping states.
- **Submit-time context capture**: every question is answered against a snapshot of the
  page visible at the moment Send was pressed.
- **Autonomous interventions**: LLM-decided help offers, pedagogical questions, pause
  suggestions and page rephrasings, gated by per-mode dwell and cooldown policy
  (`discret` / `normal` / `coach`).
- **Metacognitive engine**: six hidden gauges (attention, comprehension, curiosity,
  retention, creativity, metacognition) feeding a long-term profile with an adaptive
  blending factor.
- **Adaptive questioning pipeline**: question → answer → evaluation → feedback →
  flashcard, non-blocking.
- **Session flow**: concentration airlock with an AI-generated curiosity hook, flash
  review of due flashcards, free reading, end-of-session synthesis and reflection.
- **Source-code reading**: imported source files are paginated into readable code blocks.
- **Bilingual FR/EN** interface, with the LLM prompt language following the UI choice.
- **Fully local inference** via Ollama (`gemma4:e4b`), with graceful degradation when
  the model is unavailable.
- Desktop shell (`pywebview` + FastAPI + React/Vite), versioned SQLite schema with
  incremental migrations, PyInstaller packaging for macOS and Windows, and CI covering
  tests, lint, frontend build and security scans.
